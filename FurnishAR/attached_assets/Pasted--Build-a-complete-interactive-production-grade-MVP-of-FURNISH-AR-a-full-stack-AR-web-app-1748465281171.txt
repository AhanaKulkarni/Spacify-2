Build a complete interactive production-grade MVP of **FURNISH-AR**, a full-stack AR web application tailored exclusively for **interior designers and interior design firms**. It must work seamlessly across desktop and mobile, support 2D+3D room building, model placements, live AR visualization, editable nodes, Vastu, collaboration, and moodboards. Use placeholder data and in-browser storage where needed. Backend logic for subscriptions and model uploads should be **simulated** in the frontend. And I will be editing this app's AR portion in VS code further, so make sure whatever you create works perfectly well in VSCODE.

## 🧠 CORE PURPOSE : 

> FURNISH-AR is not for general users. It is a **power tool** for interior designers. It simplifies client interactions and room design with real-time 3D + AR visualization, editable 2D node-based rooms, model swaps, moodboards, and collaborative tools — **without needing CAD knowledge**.

It must allow a designer to:

1. Create scaled rooms based on dimensions
2. Edit 2D shape of room via draggable node points
3. View the updated room in 3D and AR
4. Place furniture from a categorized catalog
5. Upload custom GLTF/GLB models (simulate limit logic)
6. Collaborate with clients via view-only or edit-enabled links
7. Toggle **Vastu mode** to get directional-based tips
8. Build moodboards, add notes, export invoices
9. Simulate subscription limits (3 uploads on free, 25 on pro, unlimited on studio)
10. Work offline without server reliance for MVP

👉 **DO NOT scaffold empty files. Build everything end-to-end.**
👉 Use placeholder assets and state. Treat this as a working MVP for real-world demos.
👉 Focus on functional interactivity — especially for the room dimension → editable 2D → live 3D sync → AR → customization pipeline.
👉 Prioritize designer’s POV — make it intuitive, clean, responsive.
